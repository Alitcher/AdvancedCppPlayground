# C++ Template Exercises

This repository contains a collection of C++ template exercises of varying difficulty levels. Each exercise focuses on different aspects of template programming in C++.


# Task List


1. Create a simple function template that can add two numbers of any type. (Difficulty: 1)

2. Write a function template that can swap two variables of any type. (Difficulty: 1)

3. Write a class template for a 2D point. The class should have two members x and y, and a member function to print the point coordinates. (Difficulty: 2)
Include a distance function that can compute the distance between the current point and another point. (Difficulty: 3)

4. Create a function template to find the larger of an array of items. Test it with arrays of integers, doubles, and strings. (Difficulty: 2)
5. Write a class template to represent a Matrix. Implement member functions to perform matrix addition and multiplication. (Difficulty: 4)
6. Create a class template for a linked list. Implement functions to add an element, remove an element, and display the list. (Difficulty: 4)
7. Write a class template for a simple binary tree. Implement member functions for adding elements and traversing the tree. (Difficulty: 5)

8. Create a class template for a stack data structure. Implement functions for push, pop, and top operations. (Difficulty: 3)

9. Implement a generic function that takes a lambda function as argument and applies this function to a given value. (Difficulty: 4)

10. Implement a template version of a function that can count the number of occurrences of a particular value in an array of elements of any type. (Difficulty: 3)

11. Create a class template that overloads the () operator. (Difficulty: 4)

12. Write a class template for a simple hash table implementation. (Difficulty: 6)

13. Implement an algorithm (like Bubble sort, Quick sort, etc.) as a function template. (Difficulty: 5)

14. Write a function template that takes an array of any type and an operation, and applies the operation to all elements of the array. (Difficulty: 4)

15. Implement a function template that accepts a functor. Use this template to find the maximum and minimum values in a collection. (Difficulty: 6)

16. Write a template class for a Graph data structure. Implement functions for adding nodes and edges. (Difficulty: 7)

17. Implement a custom allocator using class template for a dynamic array data structure. (Difficulty: 8)

18. Write a template class for a Smart Pointer implementation. (Difficulty: 9)

19. Implement a generic version of the Observer pattern using templates. (Difficulty: 10)
